"""Assert the fixture counts stated in README.md match the fixture set.

The README states the expected verifier result in two places: the continuous
verification list ("N pass, 0 fail") and the implementations table ("N / N
PASS"). Both are measurements over fixtures/, so they are enforced here
rather than maintained by hand. They drifted apart once already: the table
still claimed 11 / 11 after the fixture set had grown to 20.

Exit 0 when every stated count matches the fixture set, 1 otherwise.
